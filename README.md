# BDD Mini Project

The objective of this project was so test the functionality of the process of purchasing an item from an automation practice website. This was achieved using Selenium and Cucumber by modelling the pages of the website using the 'POM' technique. Each webpage that represents the intermediary steps between initally adding an item to the cart, all the way through to the order confirmation, was modelled with a corresponding class. This approach allowed for simple extension of the program should more functionality be added to the site. Users (including those without knowledge of programming) will be able to create new tests by creating new .feature files in the 'features' package in the resources directory. The creation of a new scenario requires the definition of the steps required to achieve this scenario also, which should be placed in the 'stepdefs' package under 'cucumber'. Developers may wish to make use of existing methods within each class in order to achieve this, however it is also possible to add new functionality if necessary.
